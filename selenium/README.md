#### Autotest UI module

Implemented a test from a test task
To run the module, run the command:

    mvn clean test -pl=selenium             
    
Disclaimer: unfortunately, I have never written UI tests, I write only Back, this is my first experience in UI
 (I don’t know why HR didn’t notice this in my resume) and at the moment I mainly write test
frameworks rather than autotests, in any case, I will be grateful for constructive criticism.
